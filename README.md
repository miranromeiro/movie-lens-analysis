## Steps to execute
- Have Python installed.

- Generate venv

```bash
 python -m venv venv
```

Add in the root folder the "ratings.csv" and "movies.csv". It's possible to get them by downloading the file `ml-latest.zip (size 335MB)` from the Movie Lens datasets site: `https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/`

Run the `analysis.py` script.

```bash
 python analysis.py

_Ps: the `python` command is an alias and will only be available by adding it to the environment variables. Otherwise use:_

```bash
 python3 analysis.py
```
